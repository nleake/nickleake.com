                U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) manages America's immigration system. Their refugee corps reviews cases of people fleeing persecution and violence, navigating a labyrinth of legal processes to decide who can stay in America. Cases may take years to reach a decision, with many people waiting in detention.

                USCIS hired me to build a new refugee case management system. I was responsible for research, testing, and managing our backlog of work. Our goal was to save money and improve security by replacing a mainframe built in the 80s. One year later my team had created a better process that <em>saved over $10 million a year</em>. Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/zfcSZaoCizs">this video</a> to learn more about my team.

                The immigration process is a challenge for everyone involved. Immigration officers interview around a dozen applicants each week. They must hurry to complete cases while complying with shifting laws and policies. Interview new applicants within 45 days. Decide their case within 180 days. Oh, and new applications had tripled in the last five years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Refugees send paper applications to USCIS. Workers then type their information into the mainframe. We could save USCIS money by moving to the cloud, but could we create a better process? We sat with officers to find out.

                My team conducted interviews and usability tests each week. Officers found it easier to review paper case files because they could scan them faster. Many officers used rubber thimbles to protect their fingers while rifling through applications. To make our digital forms easier to review, we organized fields to mimic the
