                U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) manages America's immigration system. Their refugee corps reviews cases of people fleeing persecution and violence, navigating a labyrinth of legal processes to decide who can stay in America. Cases can take years to reach a decision, with many applicants waiting in detention.

                USCIS hired me to lead a team building a new refugee case management system. I was responsible for design, testing, and managing our team's work. Our goal was to save money and improve security by replacing a mainframe built in the 80s. One year later, <strong>we delivered a better process that saved over $10 million a year</strong>.

                The paper application forms <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/forms/i-589.pdf">require a ton of information</a>. To make our digital forms easier to review, we split each case into pages mirroring steps in the adjudication process. We also added improvements like calculated age values and a history of who modified what on the case.

                Officers had to type applicant information into several different law enforcement systems to run background checks. This was a pain because they also had to remember rules about specific name variations, situations, and populations. Our app automated this extra work using logic and APIs. Parts of the case process that had taken hours before <em>now took seconds</em>.
